1. Prepare images, masks and others by using codes in 0_prepare.
2. Prepare synthetic images by using codes in 1_synthesis.
3. Train an object detection model by using codes in 2_train_objdet. You need YOLOv10.
4. Train a classification model by using codes in 4_train_classifier.
5. Prediction can be done by using codes in 5_prediction. You need weights for the object detection model and the classification model.
